Go Playground
=============

My place to experiment with Go (without tons of little random repos).
Each experiment gets its own directory.


Experiments
-----------

* ``guessmynumber`` - I do this with almost every new programming language.
  Just enough complexity to be interesting
  (input/output/loops/conditionals/randomization) without taking more than
  a page of code.
