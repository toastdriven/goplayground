Go Playground
=============

My place to experiment with Go (without tons of little random repos).
Each experiment gets its own directory.


Experiments
-----------

* ``guessmynumber`` - I do this with almost every new programming language.
  Just enough complexity to be interesting
  (input/output/loops/conditionals/randomization) without taking more than
  a page of code.
* ``ghetto_queue`` - A basic ``Queue`` implementation, because they're my
  favorite data structure.
* ``carddeck`` - Implements a deck of playing cards. Intended for some
  simulations in the future.
* ``fizzfuckingbuzz`` - Because I needed a simple kata to bite off & it was
  a chance to play around with ``switch``.
